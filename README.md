📘 AI Coursework Project – ReadMe

This repository contains both theoretical analysis and practical implementations for an AI coursework assignment. It is divided into two main sections: Part 1 (Theory) and Part 2 (Practical). All tasks follow the given requirements and demonstrate understanding of Edge AI, Quantum AI, TensorFlow Lite deployment, and IoT-driven smart agriculture.

🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
Q1: Edge AI – Latency Reduction & Privacy Enhancement

Provide a detailed essay explaining how Edge AI processes data locally on devices (e.g., smartphones, drones, Raspberry Pi) instead of relying on cloud servers. Discuss:

How processing on-device reduces latency

How it enhances privacy by keeping data local

A real-world example such as autonomous drones using onboard inference for obstacle avoidance.

Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization Problems

Explain how Quantum AI leverages quantum properties (superposition, entanglement) to explore multiple solutions simultaneously. Compare this with classical AI algorithms which evaluate solutions sequentially. Identify industries that benefit most, such as:

Logistics

Finance

Healthcare

Manufacturing

Energy optimization

🔧 Part 2: Practical Implementation
Task 1: Edge AI Prototype – TensorFlow Lite Model

Tools: TensorFlow Lite, Google Colab or Raspberry Pi (simulation)

Goals:

Train a lightweight image classification model (e.g., identifying recyclable items: paper, plastic, metal).

Convert trained model into TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) format.

Run inference tests to verify model accuracy.

Explain why Edge AI is beneficial for real-time applications.

Deliverables:

Model training code (Python/TensorFlow)

TFLite conversion code

Inference testing script

Accuracy metrics report

Deployment steps for Raspberry Pi or similar edge device

Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Concept – Smart Agriculture System

Design a simulation using AI and IoT technologies for smart farming.

Requirements:

List required sensors (soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pH, light intensity, NPK, CO₂ sensors, etc.)

Propose an AI model for crop yield prediction (e.g., multivariate LSTM).

Sketch a data flow diagram showing how sensor data travels through IoT devices, preprocessing, AI model, and farmer dashboard.
